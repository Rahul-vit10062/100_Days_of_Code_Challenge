Question:
         A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 
                while(mp.size()==k){
                    dif = store.get(store.size()-1)-store.get(0);
                    if(dif<ans[1]-ans[0]){
                        ans[0] = store.get(0);
                        ans[1] = store.get(store.size()-1);
                    }
                    store.remove(0);
                    int t = list.get(i).getValue();
                    int vv = (int) mp.get(t);
                    mp.put(t,vv-1);
                    if(vv==1){
                        mp.remove(t);
                    }
                    i++;
                }
                
                j++;
                
            }
   
        }
        
        
        return ans;
    }
}
